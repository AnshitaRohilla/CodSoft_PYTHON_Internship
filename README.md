# CodSoft_PYTHON_Internship
I have completed my all the python tasks given in my internship by CODSOFT
TASK1
I have completed my task1 in which I have made an program which represents To Do list. Through this project you will learn to make a simple application that allows users to manage tasks they need to complete. The program typically provides an interface to add, view, delete, and mark tasks as completed. In a Python implementation, the project focuses on core programming concepts like user input, data manipulation, and persistence (saving data across program runs). It may involve basic operations like reading and writing files, working with lists and dictionaries, and creating functions for different tasks.

TASK2
I have completed my task2 in which I have made an program to generate different passwords as per need.A Password Generator is a program that automatically generates strong, random passwords for users. These passwords typically consist of a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, which makes them harder to guess or crack. A password generator can be useful for securely creating passwords for online accounts, applications, or systems without relying on easily guessed passwords or reusing passwords across multiple sites.

TASK3
I have successfully completed my task3 in which I have made an program to maintain an contact book for the user.A Contact Book in a Python project is an application that allows users to store, manage, and retrieve contact information such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, and other details. Itâ€™s similar to a digital address book or phonebook but can be expanded with additional features depending on the complexity of the project.

A simple contact book can store data temporarily within the program's runtime (in memory), or you can extend it to store contacts persistently in a file or database (e.g., CSV, JSON, or SQLite). It can also allow users to search for contacts, add new ones, delete old ones, and update existing ones.
